Factorio artillery clicker

## Deps
* Rust (Obviously)
* Need xdotool installed

## Usage
``` cargo run --release ```

Will click anything that looks like a biter nest (spawner/worm) on the map. Minimal false positives, but possible. Uses improved targetting algorythm that results in fewer artillery shells used than Vanilla targetting/ most other autoclickers, and can likely find better solutions than humans on big nests. (at least, drastically faster).
